# React + TypeScript + Vite

Description: An application that lets your search the weather for a chosen town. It displays the weather for the 7 next days and allows you to look at a specific day to have hourly details.

To install and run the project :

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) you don't have it on your machine

Then install the project :
pnpm install

And run it:
pnpm run dev

I used vitejs to launch the project quickly; with React and TS and I added Tailwind to improve the CSS a bit.
